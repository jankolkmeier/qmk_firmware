# My hhkb-like layout for space65

## Keymap
- Pretty much exactly HHKB (with the left/right-most modifiers on bottom row being FN keys)
- Right cluster is ESC,PGUP,PGDN,FN
- FN + W toggles default layer for windows/mac modifiers (this is persistent!)
- FN + FN => QMK Reset

## RGB LEDs
- master LED's show layer color
- slave LEDs lighten up / desaturate to white  while typing.
- LED's are animated using a little smoothing engine (vvv.h)
