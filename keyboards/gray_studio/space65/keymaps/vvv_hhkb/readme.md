# My hhkb-like layout for space65

LED's are animated, master LED's show layer information, slave LEDs lighten up while typing.

Right cluster is esc/pgup/dn/fn

ANSI backslash is backspace, and the default backspace key is split for backslash & grave.

Capslock is cmd/control.

FN + W => toggle windows/mac modifiers (master led toggles between gold and orange)
FN + FN => Reset (master light turns pink)
